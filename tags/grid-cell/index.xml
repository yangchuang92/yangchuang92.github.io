      <description>Brain-inspired vector navigation method for UAV based on model of multi-scale grid cells Abstract: Animals have excellent ability to perform vector navigation, which provides a useful biological model for developing a very promising paradigm of autonomous intelligent goal-directed navigation for UAV working in unknown environment. Firstly, the mechanisms of animal vector navigation are discussed. Then the mechanisms of encoding and decoding of multi-scale grid cells are studied, and a brain-inspired large-scale vector navigation method for UAV based on model of multi-scale grid cells is proposed and assessed.</description>
